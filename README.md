# Extreme-Quantile-Regression

We studied an article from Victor Chernozhukov and Iván Fernández-Val on the inference for extremal conditional quantile models, Inference for Extremal Conditional Quantile Models, with an Application to Market and Birthweight Risks, 26 Dec 2009 https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5013. This article uses extreme values (EV) theory in order to derive inference for quantile regression in extremal quantiles, that is to say when $$\tau \sim O(1/T)$$, $T$ being the number of individuals in the sample.

We decided to apply these regressions techniques to study quantiles of heart rates from individuals part of the \textit{National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health}.
